Run UserPanel- it may have a few bugs towards the latter half of the user commands since haven't been checked but the layer architechture structure 
is there.

3/15/2020 Update- Everything except 8-11 on the user panel works as LocalDate doesn't seem to be tracking time accurately. Will investigate if time is available. Also kind of wished that LocalDate would have worked with Inspections but ran into parsing issues so just left it as String.

I think this would serve as a good starter for project two.
I still need to do things like add interfaces and abstract classes along with implementing testing in some sort.


To run- download all files and run user panel
